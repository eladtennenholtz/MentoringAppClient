# MentoringAppProject

This is the client side of the app. 
There are 2 users who are supposed to use the application. 
The first user will be connected as  "mentor" and the second as the student. 
We will note that the mentor does not have a "submit" button because he cannot check the correctness of the code nor can he update the code and write in it. The mentor can view the code.

There is a "resources" folder and inside it a "resource" folder and in it there are "mock data" that can be inserted into the blocks of the editor code on the screen. 
If you are a student client and want to check the correct code, you can enter the "resource" file and check what the correct code is for each block.
